scripts
=======

Several scripts I use on my daily work

- `backup-git`: mirrors a git repository into another repository.

- `fix-gps-logmee.sh`: fix Nokia N9 GPS LogMee results, as the time format is
  not the correct one.

- `img2vdi`: convert a .img VM image into .vdi VirtualBox.

- `micmute`: mutes/unmutes laptop microphone.
  
- `redirect-mail.sh`: creates a tunnel through ssh and redirect transparently
  SMTP traffic through the tunnel.
  
- `start-xephyr.sh`: starts Xephyr server for use with Fremantle/Harmattan
  projects.
